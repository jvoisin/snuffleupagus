Snuffleupagus
=============

Snuffleupagus is a `PHP7+ <https://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php>`__ and
`PHP8+ <https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php>`__
module designed to drastically raise the cost of attacks against websites. This is achieved
by killing entire bug classes and providing a powerful virtual-patching system,
allowing the administrator to fix specific vulnerabilities without having to touch the PHP code.
